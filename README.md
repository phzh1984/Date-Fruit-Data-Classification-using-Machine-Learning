# Date-Fruit-Data-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code and information related to the classification of date fruits into seven different genetic varieties. The classification is based on external appearance features such as color, length, diameter, shape, and other image-based characteristics.

Abstract

A significant number of fruits grown worldwide exhibit various types, and their classification typically relies on external appearance characteristics. In the case of date fruits, distinguishing between varieties such as Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagai often requires expertise, time, and effort.

This project aims to classify these seven types of date fruits using image analysis and machine learning techniques. A dataset comprising 898 images of these seven date fruit types was obtained using a computer vision system. Through image processing methods, a total of 34 features, including morphological attributes, shape, and color, were extracted from these images.

Methodology

The study utilized three different machine learning methods - logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and a stacking model created by combining LR and ANN. The LR and ANN models achieved performance results of 91.0% and 92.2% accuracy, respectively. The stacking model, a combination of these methods, enhanced the performance to 92.8%.

Conclusion

The results indicate that machine learning methods, particularly when applied to image analysis and feature extraction, can successfully classify different types of date fruits. This repository provides insights into the methodologies and code implementation used for this classification task.
